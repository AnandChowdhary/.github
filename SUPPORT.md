### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier for us to help. Itâ€™s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when youâ€™re
close to a problem. Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

*   Try to define what you need help with:
    *   Is there something in particular you want to do?
    *   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
    *   Is there a concept youâ€™re not understanding?
*   Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
*   Avoid falling for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
*   Search on GitHub and Spectrum to see if a similar question has been asked
*   If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io), or a video
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
